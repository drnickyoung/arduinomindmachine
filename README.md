Step 1: WS2801_ONE_LED

This is simple example code on how to connect and control one RGB LED that uses the WS2801 driver IC.  It flashes the led red, green and blue with 1 second delay between them.


Step 2: WS2801_TWO_LEDS

This is an extension of the code from step 1. It adds another WS2801 controlled RGB LED in series with the first.  Simple RGB colour cycling is done.
